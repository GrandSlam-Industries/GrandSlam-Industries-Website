* As we are slowly growing our numbers I thought now would be a good time to make sure everyone is on the same page as to where I envision Grandslam Gaming to go. 


* Grandslam Gaming (operating as Grandslam Industries within the Star Citizen metaverse) Is a CEO run, Community driven organisation where all players can have a say on the way things are done and the direction of the organisation. 


* Initially Grandslam Industries will be Chatoic/Good alignment so it is expected that members not be jerks or pirates to other players in game, this can be changed with a vote later on.
